# Introduction

TIFY is a slim and mobile-friendly IIIF document viewer, created with performance and usability in mind.

IIIF, which stands for “International Image Interoperability Framework”, defines a set of standardized <acronym title="application programming interface">API</acronym>s for describing and delivering images along with presentational and structural metadata over the web. This allows digitized artworks, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, and archival materials to be shared between institutions and repositories. Any IIIF-compliant application can consume and display those images and metadata. [Get more information about IIIF.](http://iiif.io/about/)
